# react-tast-tracker

So another attempt to get to know the react framework better, based on [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7ejDZ8SWv8) crash course. It's a nice framework, but somehow I still couldn't find a moment to create something more complicated than the app from the first tutorial. This project is again a quick refresh and I am sure that more tutorial projects will follow up soon :wink:

## Description

Just another task app. The most intresting part for my is that json-server, which in a clever way mock the back-end part of the app

To get it working install all dependencies and run

```
npm run start
```

and then to run the mocked server run

```
npm run server
```
